Now using cookies to register user click on service. If user click service while on other page than home page, a cookie will be created and the user will
be directed to the homepage then scroll to the services section. Without the cookie it will not scroll, it will only go to homepage then jump to services-section
which does not look smooth (if you revert to commit e7313d2 where the link in the nav menu is different).

User can block cookies, that will make the service link not work.

To go back to a functional services with no cookies no animation and no glitches, revert to commit: e7313d2. fix service-secton.
